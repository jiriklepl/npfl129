#### Questions@:, Lecture 1 Questions
- Define prediction function of a linear regression model and write down
  $L^2$-regularized mean squared error loss. [5]

- Starting from unregularized sum of squares error of a linear regression model,
  show how the explicit solution can be obtained, assuming
  $\boldsymbol X^T \boldsymbol X$ is regular. [10]

#### Questions@:, Lecture 2 Questions
- Define expectation $\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$ and variance $\operatorname{Var}(f(x))$
  of a discrete random variable. Then define the bias of an estimator and show that
  estimating an expectation using a single sample is unbiased. [5]

- Describe standard gradient descent and compare it to stochastic (i.e., online) gradient
  descent and minibatch stochastic gradient descent. [5]

- Formulate conditions on the sequence of learning rates used in SGD to converge
  to optimum almost surely. [5]

- Write an $L^2$-regularized minibatch SGD algorithm for training a linear
  regression model, including the explicit formulas of the loss function and
  its gradient. [5]

#### Questions@:, Lecture 3 Questions
- Define binary classification, write down the perceptron algorithm and show
  how a prediction is made for a given example. [5]

- Show that the perceptron algorithm is an instance of stochastic gradient
  descent. Why are the learning rates not needed (i.e., why are the predictions
  of a trained model the same for all positive learning rates)? [5]

- For discrete random variables, define entropy, cross-entropy, Kullback-Leibler
  divergence, and prove the Gibbs inequality (i.e., that KL divergence is
  non-negative). [5]

- Define data distribution, empirical data distribution and likelihood. [5]

- Describe maximum likelihood estimation, as minimizing NLL, cross-entropy and
  KL divergence. [10]

- Considering binary logistic regression model, write down its parameters
  (including their size) and explain how prediction is performed (including the
  formula for the sigmoid function). Describe how we can interpret the outputs
  of the linear part of the model as logits. [5]

- Write down an $L^2$-regularized minibatch SGD algorithm for training a
  binary logistic regression model, including the explicit formulas of the
  loss function and its gradient. [10]
